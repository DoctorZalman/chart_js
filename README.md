# Getting Started with Charts JS

- Library: React JS
- Typification: TypeScript.
- Desing: MUI (dark mode style)

## The WebApp allows you to create graphs from the received data

### The main page contains two fields where the user can enter data and a graph display field

To get started - in the "Labels" field, please type words (Ex: January, February, March)

In the "Data" field, enter numbers that match the words you enter in the "Labels" field (Ex: 34, 76, 122)

When the data entry is complete, press Enter, or click the mouse outside the fields "Labels" or "Data"

### For easy perception - in the upper right corner there is an opportunity to change the color theme of the plugin. A dark theme has been set by order
